# Local-Research-QA-M1_Mac-langchain

A QA system for scientific research using LLMs locally on M1 Mac. 

## Context: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful for understanding human instructions. However, there are many instances that LLMs don't understand user queries in specific fields, such as Advanced Mathematics, Scientific Research, and Engineering. To understand the user questions, LLMs will need in-context learning from the topics as an external knowledge source. 

In this project, I will discover how to build a QA system for scientific research based on the idea of Retrieval Augmented Generalization (RAG). RAG provides external knowledge that is retrieved from selected research documents (such as PDFs). LLMs will then be able to provide helpful answers and provide insights for conducting scientific research.

## Next Step: 
1. Improve chunk splitting for pdf. documents
2. Add Chat History modules
